# Live_Spam_Detection
Call-to-Text Spam Detection System

The Redmi Spam Detection Project is a speech-to-text-based solution designed to detect spam or fraudulent keywords in audio conversations. It provides an efficient way to transcribe speech, analyze text, and identify potential spam content based on predefined keywords. This system is ideal for applications where real-time audio processing and text analysis are crucial, such as customer service monitoring, compliance checks, and secure communication channels.

Key Features

Speech-to-Text Conversion:Converts live audio input from the user's microphone into text using Google's Speech Recognition API.

Spam Detection Algorithm:Detects spam-related keywords such as "free," "offer," "urgent," and other fraudulent terms from transcriptions.

Dynamic Transcription Storage:Automatically saves transcription data to text files for future reference.

Spam Word Reporting:Generates a report of detected spam words and saves them to a dedicated file for review.

File-Based Transcription Processing:Reads and processes stored transcription files for spam detection.

User-Friendly Web Interface:Provides a clean interface for audio detection and spam analysis results.

How It Works

Audio Recording:The user initiates audio recording by speaking into the microphone.

Transcription:The system converts speech to text and saves the transcription.

Spam Detection:The text is scanned for spam keywords and flagged accordingly.

Result Presentation:The detected spam words, if any, are displayed on the web interface and saved in a dedicated text file.
